Payload is the data portion of a packet transported between two partners, which does not contain protocol data or metadata that is only sent for use in transporting the payload. Payload is usually text, signs or sounds. Payload is usually located under the header, and depending on the network protocol, there may be an additional trailer.

In computer security, a payload is a part of a piece of malware such as a worm or virus, a piece of code that is run on the victim's computer, used to perform some malicious activity, such as destroying data, sending spam or data encryption. In addition to the payload, such malware has additional overhead code to spread it, or to avoid being identified.
